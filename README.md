# Classification_ML
This repo will collect several algorithms related to the Machine Learning Classification topic.

- [Support Vector Machine classifiers](https://github.com/Tingting0618/SVM_Classifier)
- [KNeighbors (KNN) classifier](https://github.com/Tingting0618/SVM_Classifier)
- [Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifiers](https://github.com/Tingting0618/SGD_RandomForest_Classifier)
  - Advantages: being capable of handling very large datasets efficiently
- [Decision Trees](https://github.com/Tingting0618/Tree_Based_ML_Models)
- [Random Forest classifiers](https://github.com/Tingting0618/Ensemble_Learning)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Tingting0618/Logistic_Regression)
- Naive Bayes classifiers
- [Imbalanced Classification SMOTE](https://github.com/Tingting0618/Imbalanced_Classification_SMOTE)
